Motivations

Project created to improve my skills with C language.

There are few approach or even frameworks that let you write Object Oriented
code in Standard C language (C99).

I want to have a TDD approach using the Ceedling project which embed Unity
testing framework, OCMock, CException. It's so great to have such an
environment for C language.

Here is a list of the approach I want to test:
 * `Object Oriented Programming in C Approaches`_
 * `OOC Programming language`_
 * `Object Oriented Programming in C`_
 * `ID-Objmodel`_



What I get so far
_________________

Thanks to `Object Oriented Programming in C`_ reading I create a Class
structure that allows me to create/delete objects by specifying desired Class.
These methods are called new and delete.

I create a first Class called Object that handles ref_counting.

I then create a String class that inherit from Object Class just to test how to
perform inheritance.

Problem with my approach so far:
 * variables and methods are defined in private headers => they are only private
 * My *classes* are only defined as pointer (void *). I want them to be
structure or pointer to a structure in order to specify public information
about them.
 * First parameter of methods associated to classes/structures is a pointer
(void *) => compiler don't provide information about a method called with bad
object.

TODO
____

Improve unit tests associated to Object Class.


Sublime Text 2
______________

I use sublime text for this development. I have developed a new Build System
that contains the following:

	{
		"cmd": ["rake", "test:all"],
		"working_dir": "${project_path:${folder}}/"
	}
	
These task launch all the tests that are located in the _test_ directory using
the rakefile.rb file provided by Ceedling.
You just have to specify in the project.yml what is the test_file_prefix.

After you have selected the Build System to use in Tools > Build System, you
just have to hit Cmd + B to launch the unit tests and see the result.
