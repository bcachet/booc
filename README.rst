Project created to improve my skills with C language.

There are few approach or even frameworks that let you write Object Oriented code in Standard C language (C99).

I want to have a TDD approach using the Ceedling project which embed Unity testing framework, OCMock, CException.

Here is a list of the approach I want to test:
 * "Object Oriented Programming in C Approaches"_
 * "OOC Programming language"_
 * "Object Oriented Programming in C"_
